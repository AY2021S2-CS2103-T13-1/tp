## Introduction

### About WeebLingo
WeebLingo is a desktop application that helps users learn the Japanese language. It has three primary modes,
which are the **learn**, **quiz** and **history** modes. The app contains flashcards that pairs a Japanese word and
its corresponding English syllable for users to learn. It allows users to test themselves on their grasp of the Japanese language
by starting a quiz session. In addition, users can view their history of past quiz attempts and the relevant statistics.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
eg. if the command specifies `n/NUMBER t/TAG`, `t/TAG n/NUMBER` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
eg. if you specify `n/5 n/10`, only `n/10` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `next` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help あいうえお`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my quiz attempt scores to other computers?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file
that contains the data of your previous WeebLingo home folder.

**Q**: Can I add my customized flashcards?<br>
**A**: Sorry, the current version of the application does not allow self-defined flashcards to be added. However, if you
are advanced and know how to manipulate the storage files, you can do so if you want. However, the application assumes
a certain format for each data field, thus if you modified the data wrongly, the app will use the fallback option, which
is to load the storage file with built-in default flashcards and tags.

**Q**: Why can't I delete some tags?<br>
**A**: Default tags are provided by the application to aid in the learning process and guide you along the way. You can,
however, add your own tags to any flashcard. The deletion of tags exists is to complement this user tagging function, 
in case you have a change of mind or typed any tag wrongly.

**Q**: I just want to do a short quiz! Is there any way to do that?<br>
**A**: There are multiple ways to set up a shorter quiz session: one would be to start with a selected number of
questions, and let the application randomise some questions for you. The other option could be to tag questions you
would like to be tested on; starting with these tags will give you a quiz session with only these selected flashcards.
A combination of the above two options is also possible.

## Note for Testers
By the nature of the type of application Weeblingo is, it is inconvenient for testers who do not possess some elementary
knowledge of Japanese to test our application.

Therefore, to facilitate testers, we have provided a list of flashcards which reside in the database
of the current version of application for your reference. The link is [here](Flashcards.html).
