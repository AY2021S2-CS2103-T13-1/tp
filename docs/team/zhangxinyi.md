## Project: Weeblingo

Weeblingo is a desktop app for managing flashcards, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With a nice and friendly interface,
users can learn Japanese at a comfortable pace with this application.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to check user attempts during quiz session.
  * What it does: Allows user to check if own attempt matches the correct answer of the flashcard currently tested 
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as user can test themselves to see if they truly understand 
  the given questions.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allowed implementation of more features, such as scoring, which are crucial for our app

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=xyzhang&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=xyzhang00&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**: 
  * Assigned issues to relevant parties for efficient responsibility management

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored code to more suit our application (Pull request [#59](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/59))
  * Refactored code to fix OOP principles violations resulted from lack of understanding of code base during early project (Pull request [#77](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/77/files))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide: 
    * Added documentation for features `learn`, `quiz`, `start`, `check`, `next`
