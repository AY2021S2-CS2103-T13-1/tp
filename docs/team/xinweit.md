## Project: Weeblingo

Weeblingo is a desktop app for learning the Japanese language via flashcards. It is designed specifically with the needs
of budding Japanese language students in mind, providing everything one would need to embark on their academic journey.
With a simple and friendly design and carefully crafted user-centric features, one can learn Japanese at a comfortable
pace to the level of proficiency one desires.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to record duration of a quiz session.
    * What it does: Allows the user to see the duration he spent on the quiz session.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can gauge their grasp of the Japanese
      language based on how fast they can answer questions.
    * Highlights: This enhancement allows the duration of the quiz session to be saved in the quiz history for future viewing.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to choose number of questions for a quiz session.
    * What it does: Allows the user to choose the number of questions for a quiz session.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product because it allows the user to 
      roughly control the time spent on a quiz session, enhancing user experience and flexibility.
    * Highlights: This feature is essential to the application. Without it, each quiz session will test 
      all the flashcards in the database. This requires the user to spend long periods
      of time to complete the quiz session with no flexibility provided.
