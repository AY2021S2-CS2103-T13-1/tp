## **Setting Up, Getting Started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `learn`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`FlashcardListPanel`, `ScoreHistoryListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WeeblingoParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. updating mode).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("learn")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `learn` Command](images/LearnSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `LearnCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model Component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the flashcard book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` and `ObservableList<Score>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FlashcardBook`, which `Flashcard` references. This allows `FlashcardBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the flashcard book data (flashcards and scores) in json format and read it back.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.weeblingo.commons`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/weeblingo/commons) 
package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Learn Mode

The `learn` command is used to enter Learn Mode, allowing the user to view all flashcards with the question and answer
both displayed. Tagging and deletion of tags is also only available in this mode. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to enter Learn Mode:

![LearnModeActivityDiagram](images/LearnModeActivityDiagram.png)

### [Implemented] Tagging Flashcards

The tagging mechanism allows users to add tags to flashcards of their choice while in the Learn Mode
of the Weeblingo application. Each flashcard has a set of default tags which cannot be edited, followed by
any unique user added tags.

![Structure of the Flashcard with tags](images/FlashcardWithTagsObjectDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user adds a new tag:

![NewTagActivityDiagram](images/NewTagActivityDiagram.png)

The tags function ties together with the Start, Learn and Quiz function of the application,
as users can choose to start a quiz, enter Start Mode or enter Learn Mode with a filtered set of flashcards.

### [Implemented] Deleting Tags from Flashcards

This mechanism works with the above flashcard tagging feature to allow users to customise tags for their flashcards
while in the Learn Mode of the Weeblingo application. 

The following sequence diagram summarises how the DeleteTagCommand works:
![QuizSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTagSequenceDiagram.png)

Default tags cannot be deleted by this command and will throw an error if the user attempts to do so.

### [Implemented] Quiz Feature

The quiz feature for users to test the vocabulary is facilitated by `Model#Quiz`, `Model#Mode` and `Logic`. It does so by allowing a `Command`
to set model to quiz mode. When model is in quiz mode, it will take commands allowing users to start a quiz session,
attempt answering the quiz question or skip the flashcard.

`Model#Mode` implments the following operations:
  * `switchModeQuiz()`: Sets model to quiz mode
  * `switchModeQuizSession()`: Sets model to quiz session mode
  * `switchModeCheckSuccess()`: Sets model to check success mode 
  * `switchModeQuizSessionEnded()`: Sets model to quiz session ended mode

`Model#Quiz` implments the following operations:
  * `getRandomisedQueue()`: Generates randomised questions for the quiz session
  * `getNextQuestion()`: Provides a question to be bested
  * `isCorrectAttempt(Answer attempt)`: Checks if attempt is correct English definition of question shown on flashcard

These operations are executed through `QuizCommand`, `StartCommand`, `CheckCommand` and `NextCommand` in the `Logic` class.

#### Entering Quiz Mode

The `quiz` command is used to enter Quiz mode, allowing the user to start various quizzes from there.
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters the Quiz command:

![QuizActivityDiagram](images/QuizActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the Quiz command works:

![QuizSequenceDiagram](images/QuizSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Starting a Session

The `start` command is used to start a quiz session, enabling users to define the number and categories of
questions they want to be tested on. The activity diagram below shows the flow of events when a user
enters the start command.

![StartActivityDiagram](images/StartActivityDiagram.png)

Thr following sequence diagram shows the interactions that occur when the start command is executed:

![StartSequenceDiagram](images/StartSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Checking User Attempt

The `check` command is used to check if user provided attempt is correct. This feature is implemented by creating an 
instance of `CheckCommand` that can be executed on the `Model`. The `Model` will then invoke appropriate methods in `Quiz`.
Depending on whether the user attempt is correct, `CheckCommand` will return an instance of `CommandResult` which will 
inform the `MainWindow` if it is time to reveal the answer of current question.

The following activity diagram summarizes the general workflow of `check` command:
<img src="images/CheckCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the `check` command works:
![CheckCommandSequenceDiagram](images/CheckCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Quiz Scoring

The quiz can be scored for each individual quiz session. The scoring data will be written into the storage file
after the quiz session is completed. A quiz session is completed if and only if the message indicating the end of
quiz is displayed in the GUI window. The following activity diagrams summarize how the score is generated and recorded
along with each quiz session.

![QuizScoringSequenceDiagram](images/QuizScoringSequenceDiagram-How_is_score_produced_with_quiz__.png)

![QuizScoringSequenceDiagramRake](images/UserSeeQuestionDuringQuizActivityDiagram-User_sees_a_question_during_quiz__.png)


#### View Past Quiz Attempts

The view quiz history mechanism allows users to view their past attempts of quizzes. Each entry of quiz history is
represented in a way similar to how the flashcards are represented in the Weeblingo application.

Below is the class diagram
for how `Score` is represented in *Model* component.

![HistoryModelDiagram](images/HistoryModelDiagram.png)

The *UI* component, which originally only handles the display of flashcards,
now needs to handle the display for scoring history as well.

The following sequence diagram shows how the UI switches display from flashcards to score history. The mechanism of
switching UI display the other way around is similar. 

![HistoryUiSequenceDiagram](images/HistoryUiSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to represent `Score` in the application

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make `Score` and `Flashcard` two separate classes.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons:
      * May have the overhead of writing similar code. For instance, `JsonAdaptedFlashcard` and `JsonAdaptedScore`.
      * Changing the GUI display from flashcards to score history may be cumbersome.
* **Alternative 2:** Let `Score` have inheritance relationship with `Flashcard`.
    * Pros: Changing GUI display is easy.
    * Cons:
      * The design choice is not intuitive (`Score` does not seem to be a `Flashcard` and vice versa).
      * The overhead of maintaining the inheritance is non-trivial.

### [Proposed] Auto-tagging feature for difficult Flashcards

The proposed feature will track user attempts for each flashcard and suggest tagging flashcards that took more than a
set number of attempts as difficult at the end of the quiz. This is facilitated by the `check` command triggering an
internal check on the current number of attempts for this `flashcard`. Beyond a set number of attempts, the `Quiz` will
store the current `flashcard` in a separate list to be shown at the end of the quiz. The user can then tag them as
difficult if they so wish to.

`Model#Quiz` will implement the following operation:
* `Quiz#updateDifficult`: Adds the current `flashcard` to the list of difficult flashcards.

### [Proposed] Tag Search
The tag searching feature will allow users to view and search through the tags that exist, such that they can easily
know what tags are available to be used. `Tag` will store a static map of each tag to the number of flashcards with
that tag, updating as needed when a tag is added or deleted.

`Model#Tag` will implement the following operations:
* `Tag#showTags()`: Iterates through the map and shows all existing tags.
* `Tag#doesTagExist(Tag tag)`: Checks if tag exists.
* `Tag#tagCount(Tag tag)`: Searches the map for the number of flashcards with the provided tag. If the tag does not
  exist, it should return 0.

These operations will be executed through `ShowTagsCommand` and `SearchTagsCommand` in the `Logic` class.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

By the nature of Weeblingo, it is inconvenient for testers who do not possess some elementary
knowledge of Japanese to test our application. Therefore, to facilitate testers, we have provided a list of flashcards which reside in the database
of the current version of application for your reference. The link is [here](Flashcards.html).

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Using the  `end` command

1. Ending a quiz before it is started

   1. Prerequisites: No quiz has been started

   1. Test case: `end` _while in the quiz_<br>
      Expected: The current quiz is ended and displayed flashcard disappears.

   1. Test case: `end` _while in the start menu_<br>
      Expected: Nothing happens. An error message is displayed to the user telling them that no Quiz has started yet.

   1. Other incorrect end commands locations to try: _while in learn mode_, _right after ending a Quiz, â€¦â€‹ <br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with corrupted data files

   1. Do an initial launch of the application as described in _Launch and shutdown_ segment above. Type `learn` to view all flashcards available.
   
   1. Open `current_folder/data/flashcards.json`.
    
   1. Do some modifications that are possibly malicious.
       - Modify a field name of `flashcards.json`. E.g. change `question` to `questions`
       - Modify the `tag` value of some flashcard to include characters that are neither alphabetic or numeric. E.g. `&*&`, `ä½ å¥½ä¸–ç•Œ`.
       - Modify the `question` value of some flashcard to include latin-specific characters. E.g. `EspaÃ±ol`.
   

   1. Relaunch the application. Type `learn` to go into the `learn` mode. Original (unmodified) data content should present.
    
   1. **Close the application** and inspect the `flashcards.json` file. Modified parts of the original data content should disappear.
    
    
1. Dealing with missing data files

   1. Delete the `flashcards.json` file, but keep the `data` folder.

   1. Relaunch the application. Type `learn` to go into the `learn` mode. Original data content should present.

   1. **Close the application** and inspect the `data` folder, a new `flashcards.json` loaded with content should be present.
    
   1. Now delete the `data` folder recursively (i.e. deleting the file(s) inside it as well).

   1. Repeat the second step.

   1. **Close the application**, and the `data` folder and the `flashcards.json` should be present (regenerated).
    
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: Data file is recovered on a lazy basis. That is, if the data file is corrupted/missing, and a new application instance is
  created and then closed without **any** command entered. The data file will not be recovered.
